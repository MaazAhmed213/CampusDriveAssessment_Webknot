A campus drive application using Rest apis, streamlit and sqlite db built fully using agentic ai (crew ai framework). 

AI conversation logs- https://github.com/MaazAhmed213/CampusDriveAssessment_Webknot/blob/main/ai_conversationLog.md

Used agentic ai framework instead of traditional prompting to make smooth, structured and fast code generation.
We can reuse this code with prompt edits to make any application making quick reusability possible thanks to agentic ai.

To view prompts used, open agents.py and tasks.py file.

Student Registration: Allows students to register with their name, email, and college id
Event Attendance: Enables marking of attendance for students at different events
Feedback Collection: Collects feedback from students
Report Generation: Provides reports on total registrations, attendance percentage, average feedback, event popularity, and top active students.

**Basic flow:** 

1) Setup llm (openai gpt4)
2) Add openai api key in .env file
3) Setup agents,tasks and crew (give proper prompts). This solution is using 5 agents.
4) Call agents in app.py
5) It will generate a working python code, sql file and streamlit ui, all integrated and ready to be used in 1 go (remove special characters in the generated file as llm response conmtains ''' at the beginning and end.
6) Campus drive application is now ready to use, fully autonomously built using genAi.

**Steps to run the campus drive application:**

1. setup new virtual environment-
python -m venv venv

Activate venv:
Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

3. install requirements-
pip install flask flask-cors streamlit requests

4. open 2 terminals,
   Terminal 1: python3 main.py (start flask server)
   Terminal 2: streamlit run streamlit_app.py


**Steps to run the Agentic AI Code generation solution:** 

**WARNING!!!! IF YOU RUN THIS, THE ENTIRE CAMPUS DRIVE APPLICATION WILL GET RE-WRITTEN WITH NEW AI GENERATED CODE! TEST CAMPUS DRIVE APPLICATION CODE FIRST AND THEN CREATE A NEW CLONE TO TEST AGENTIC AI SOLUTION!!!!!**

This code will automatically generate sql schema, design documentation, python code (api endpoints) and streamlit ui, all automatically by itself with zero human intervention. 
Basically full application and documentations created using ai with zero human intervention. 

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE MIN PYTHON 3.11

1. setup new virtual environment-
python -m venv venv

2. Activate venv:
Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

3. install requirements
pip install 'crewai[tools]' python-dotenv langchain-openai Flask Flask-Cors streamlit requests

4. create .env file and add your openai api key:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=Your key here

5. python3 app.py

Agents used summary:
Agent 1- The Architect(The Planner):
First agent is Senior System Architect. It will provide detailed design document, figuring out what data to track, how the database should be structured and what API endpoints are needed. It basicaly created the blueprint for the whole operation

Agent 2- The DBA(The Foundation Builder):
Once the blueprint is ready, the Database Administrator agent will read architects database schema and make it into a clean, functional schema.sql file. This agent's main focus is to create the foundation for our application data for all the tables and relationships

Agent 3- The Backend Dev (The Engineer):
This agent's task is to prepare api endpoints. It used the design document and the SQL schema to build the entire Flask API. It wrote the code for every endpoint like registering students, marking attendance, handling feedback, and generating reportsâ€”turning the static design into a working code.

Agent 4- The Frontend Dev (The UI/UX Specialist):
The Frontend Developer is used to build the ui. It analyzed the backend code to understand the available API endpoints and then built a streamlit application. This agent focused on creating a simple and intuitive UI, allowing a real user to click buttons, fill out forms, and see the reports, making the whole system usable.

Agent 5- The Technical Writer (The Documenter):
Its job is to create documentations. It reviewed the work of all the other agents to provide clear instructions on what the project does, what features it has, and how to get it set up and running on your own machine.

All the agents interact together to provide fully functional, ready to use application with no human effort (effort put only to create this agentic ai solution).
Using agentic ai methods, we can create agents who are masters of multiple technologies and make them work together to create any solutions.
