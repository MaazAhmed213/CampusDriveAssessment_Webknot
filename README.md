# Campus Event Management System

## Project Title & Overview
The Campus Event Management System is a prototype application designed to facilitate the management of campus events. It provides functionalities for student registration, event attendance tracking, feedback collection, and report generation. The system is built using a Flask backend API and a Streamlit frontend interface.

## Features
- **Student Registration**: Allows students to register with their name, email, and associated college ID.
- **Event Attendance**: Enables marking of attendance for students at specific events.
- **Feedback Collection**: Collects feedback from students for events, including a rating system.
- **Report Generation**: Provides reports on total registrations, attendance percentage, average feedback, event popularity, and top active students.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: Ensure `requirements.txt` includes `Flask`, `Flask-Cors`, `sqlite3`, `streamlit`, and `requests`.*

### Database Initialization
Initialize the SQLite database:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will create the necessary tables in `campus_events.db`.

## Running the Application

### Start the Flask Server
Run the Flask server to handle API requests:
```bash
python main.py
```
The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Start the Streamlit UI
Run the Streamlit application to access the user interface:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Access the application at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.
